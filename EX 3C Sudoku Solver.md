# EX 3C Sudoku Solver
## DATE: 11/03/25
## AIM:
To write a python program to find the solution of sudoku puzzle using Backtracking.


## Algorithm

1. Traverse the board to find the first empty cell (value `0`).  
2. Try placing numbers `1` to `9`** in that cell.  
3. Check safety the number must not repeat in the row, column, or 3Ã—3 subgrid.  
4. If safe, place the number and recursively solve the rest of the board.  
5. Backtrack by resetting the cell if the move leads to no solution.  
6. Print board when all cells are filled correctly.
